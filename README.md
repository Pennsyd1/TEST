## Consumer Complaints

## Description

In this project we analyzed data about consumer complaints received by the consumer financial protection bureau. We wanted to visualize the  following:

- The proportion of response types
- The  trend of the consumer complaints by month
- A count of the complaints by product
- The top 10 companies that received the most complaints.

The data was found from the consumer data protection bureau and we took a csv from the website that we then cleaned and uploaded to a sql database.
